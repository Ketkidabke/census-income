# census-income
In this project, I worked on the Census Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that contains the income information for over 48,000 individuals taken from the 1994 US census.
For more details about this dataset, you can refer to the following link:

Problem Statement:
In this project, initially I preprocess the data and then develop an understanding of the different features of the data by performing exploratory analysis and creating visualizations. Further, after having sufficient knowledge about the attributes, you will perform a predictive task of classification to predict whether an individual makes over 50,000 a year or less by using different machine learning algorithms.
